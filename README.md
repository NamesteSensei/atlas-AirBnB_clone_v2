# AirBnB Clone - Web Framework with Flask

## Project Overview
This project is part of the AirBnB clone series. In this phase, we use **Flask**, a lightweight web framework, to create dynamic web applications. This project demonstrates the basics of Flask routing, templates, and integration with MySQL.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will be able to:
- Explain what a Web Framework is and its purpose.
- Build a basic web application using Flask.
- Define and handle routes in Flask.
- Use templates to create dynamic HTML responses with Jinja.
- Connect a MySQL database and display data in HTML.

## Requirements
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Flask** (Install using `pip3 install Flask`)
- **MySQL**
- **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** (or WSL2 with Ubuntu 20.04 for Windows users)

## Project Structure
- `web_flask/`: Contains all Flask application scripts.
  - `0-hello_route.py`: Starts a simple Flask application with one route.
  - `1-hbnb_route.py`: Adds an additional route `/hbnb` to the application.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Running the Application
To run the application, navigate to the `web_flask` directory and use the following command:

```bash
python3 -m web_flask.[script_name]
